Response time reduction during Heart attack
Overview:
The project aims to help patients with heart conditions and provide timely help to them by using IOT.

Problem Statement:
Patients with heart condition need immediate help in case of heart attack. The time between an attack and medical support is very crucial which should be reduced as much as possible.

Solution:
To solve this problem, hospitals can provide the patients with IOT devices which are capable of detecting heart attack. This sensor monitors pulse rate, blood pressure and other vital signs and maintains history of this data. In case of irregularities in these vital signs, the sensor will immediately send the information to the hospital. The hospital can take quick action by sending ambulance, informing the relatives of patient, scheduling medical staff of hospital required in case of heart attack eventually reducing response time with the help of IOT.

Key entities/Roles:

1.	Hospital
2.	Patient
3.	Heart attack detecting Sensor
4.	Patient medical history
5.	Ambulance
